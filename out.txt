Exercise 485. Design the function split.
 Use the accumulator design recipe to im
prove on the result of exercise 484. Aft
er all, the hints already point out that
 when the function discovers the correct
 split point, it needs both parts of the
 list and one part is obviously lost due
 to recursion. image

Once you have solv
ed this exercise, equip the main functio
n of A Graphical Editor, Revisited with 
a clause for mouse clicks. As you experi
ment with moving the cursor via mouse cl
icks, you will notice that it does not e
xactly behave like applications that you
 use on your other devices—even though s
plit passes all its tests.

Graphical pr
ograms, like editors, call for experimen
tation to come up with best “look and fe
el” experiences. In this case, your edit
or is too simplistic with its placement 
of the cursor. After the applications on
 your computer determine the split point
, they also determine which letter divis
ion is closer to the x-coordinate and place the cursor there.
